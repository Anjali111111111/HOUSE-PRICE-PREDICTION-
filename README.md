# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-
This project is a Machine Learning project along with flask that predicts house prices based on key property features. The model is trained on the Ames Housing Dataset and deployed using Flask with an interactive web interface.

🔥 Features

1) Predicts house prices using features like:

2) Overall Quality

3) Living Area (sqft)

4) Basement Area

5) Floor Area

6) Garage Size & Capacity

7) Year Built

8) Lot Area

9) Number of Bathrooms and many more...

This project provides-         

* Clean and user-friendly web interface

* Interactive chart visualization of predictions vs average price

* Deployed locally using Flask

⚙ Tech Stack

* Python 🐍

* Flask (backend & routing)

* Pandas / NumPy (data preprocessing)

* Scikit-Learn (machine learning model)

* HTML / CSS / JavaScript (frontend)

* Chart.js (visualization)

📊 Model Training

Dataset: Ames Housing Dataset

Preprocessing:   
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Log transformation on target variable
- Model: Random Forest Regressor (with hyperparameter tuning)
- Metric: R² Score & RMSE

  
*🎯 *Future Improvement
- Deploy on Heroku / AWS / Render for public access
- Add more visualization features
- Allow CSV file upload for bulk predictions
- Improve UI/UX with modern frontend frameworks
